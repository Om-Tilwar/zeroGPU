This is a sample document. LangChain is a framework for developing applications powered by language models. It provides building blocks for chaining together language models with other components, such as APIs and external data sources. This enables developers to create more complex and powerful applications, like chatbots that can answer questions about specific documents, or systems that can summarize large amounts of text.
